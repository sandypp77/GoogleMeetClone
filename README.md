# GoogleMeetClone
Google Meet Clone developed by mediasoup as WebRTC, nodeJS, Socket.io, and vue as front end

The web is still under development process, the chat system and auth system for account not yet added.
The webRTC system works fine but maybe still need a few updates incase there's an error in the process.

To deploy run it, u must build it first
'npm run build'

And then, start the nodejs server.
'npm start'
